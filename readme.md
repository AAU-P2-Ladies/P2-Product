# Style guide



* camelCase for function and variable creation
* Make specific index naming(avoid x, i & j)
* In for loops, try to use "of" when possible
* End every expression with a semicolon 
* Whenever you encapsulate code with curly bracket, place the start bracket on the sameline and the end bracket on its own line
