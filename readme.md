# Style guide



* camelCase for function and variable creation
```js
function camelCase();

var camelCase;
```
* Make specific index naming(avoid x, i & j)
* In for loops, try to use "of" when possible
* End every expression with a semicolon 
* Whenever you encapsulate code with curly bracket, place the start bracket on the sameline and the end bracket on its own line
* After if/for/function declarations, no space before curly bracket
* Two empty lines between function declarations
* No space between declarations like functions and parentheses
* Logical statements can omit "== true" when possible
* Comments with //
* Comments above each function defining input, output and general purpose
* Comments within function when necessary above the line/loop/statement that is being explained
* Else on its own line
* Kamilla and Sina can use snake case if they want to
